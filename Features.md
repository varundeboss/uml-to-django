Features:

  * uml-to-django is OS independent (runs as a python script)
  * compatible with most UML authoring softwares
  * Rapid development: no programming involved; only one command to type to generate the interface from the class diagram.
  * Support for django and user-defined data types
  * Support for full customisation of the model and admin interface after it has been generated. Customisation won't be lost with subsequent conversions of the updated diagram.
  * Support for 1..1, 1..n associations, inheritance and self-reference (i.e. association from a class to the same class).
  * Allows the inline help text in the admin interface to be generated from the UML diagram.
  * Support for field constraints such as Primary Key and Not Null.
